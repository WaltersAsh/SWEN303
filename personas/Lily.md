**Bio:**
Lily Walters is a 20-year-old student studying at Victoria University of Wellington. 
She is a first-year student studying a BSc in psychology and currently reinforces her studies by using flashcards with the lack of time she has. 
This year, one of her lecturers has set up the SQS, which is available for her to use. 
After a tough decision in Lily's life, she has decided to study as a backup after COVID-19 restrictions on the national marathon championship that she planned to participate in.
She values her training and tries to be as efficient as possible to maintain her studies.

**Activities:**
Lily often wakes up early before sunrise on weekdays to train and run around the waterfront to get her daily 10 kilometres in.
She spends midday and the afternoon on campus, attending lectures and trying to study.
For the rest of the evening, she trains at her local gym and rests early.
At weekends she enjoys her scenic run on her Mount Victoria route and does her best to push her limits. 
When she is relaxing, she enjoys watching Netflix and playing chess.

**Attitudes:**
Lily is an impulsive individual and highly competitive.
Often she is very stubborn and tired due to her excessive training and the will to push her limits.

**Aptitudes:**
Lily excels in physical sports and activities. She has a good balance of agility, stamina and strength on the tracks. She is also intelligent, with a high sense of pattern recognition and forming strategies.
 
**Weaknesses:**
Lily suffers from time management and a lack of motivation due to the pressure she puts on herself in her training. 
She focuses too much on running, as a result of this, she often forgets deadlines.

**Domain Knowledge:**
Lily has never used an SQS before but has some understanding of the collaborative aspect in the interaction between creating and answering questions.

**System Knowledge:**
Lily does have some information as she just started using it in her psychology course. She also has some experience with systems specialising in creating digital shared flashcards from high school.

**Interaction:**
Lily uses the SQS a couple of times a day to answer and rate questions depending on her motivation. If she is confident enough, she will create questions on the topics she knows well.

**Priorities:**
Lily wants a smooth interaction with the system, that is fast and easy to use. She wants something that you can engage easily and focus on. She does not want to be held back by a system that is hard to learn and is tedious to access.

**Motivations:**
Lily's goal is to pass her university courses and acquire her bachelors while having enough time to train for the national marathon championships. If her athletic goal does not work out, she will continue her academic journey towards a career as a psychologist.  

**Computer self-efficacy:**
Lily is able to perform the key tasks in the SQS, such as creating, answering and commenting on questions. Sometimes she gets frustrated when she submits an answer accidentally or changes her mind when submitting a comment. 

**Risk tolerance:**
Lily has a low to medium risk tolerance. She often hesitates but will give new systems a chance, but if she has a lot of poor interactions with them, she will go back to systems that have worked for her in the past.

**Information Processing:**
Lily does not enjoy taking in a lot of information too much. She enjoys simplicity such as reading key points from her notes and lecture slides, rather than reading full chapters from her online textbooks. 

**Tinkering:**
Lily does not tinker with systems that often. She only tries and experiments when she is trying to achieve a certain task in the system, or when the system malfunctions (or the perception of it, is malfunctioning), she tinkers as much as possible. This typically exacerbates the problem.
