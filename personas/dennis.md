Dennis is a 19-year-old second-year student studying at Victoria University of Wellington. His degree is the Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. Dennis lives in Education House and can go to campus every day. Dennis’s study goal is to get a degree as smoothly as possible without needing to repeat courses. His life goals are to get a well-paying but still interesting job that can support his living costs.    

Dennis primarily uses PeerWise to quickly study testable material and quickly get help with his assignments.  

**Interactions:**
Dennis uses PeerWise when the need arises, to find learning material and course information on the day before tests and the week before assignment due dates.  

**Concentration ability:**
Dennis has difficulty maintaining workflow for more than a few minutes at a time and is easily distracted by stimuli in the environment.  

**Time management:**
Dennis frequently starts assignments and studies for tests close to their due dates. Late starts then domino into leaving only a little time before due dates of subsequent assessments. His workload is slightly more complicated to manage than that of most students in his courses due to having two majors with different delivery styles.  

**Reading ability:**
Dennis needs instructions clarified and clearly laid out. He also needs learning material to be displayed in a logical flow that makes it easy to know what parts are related to what concept, and how the concept fits in with the outline of the course.  

**Stresses in the environment:**
Dennis’ room in Education House is small, and there is no space to separate his work area from his relax area. The noise from the city makes it hard for him to get to sleep. Dennis needs to plan and prepare his own meals, and he is limited by the small kitchenette in his room. Dennis is also anxious about budgeting his spending on essentials and the stressful behaviour of his parents of whom he depends on for an allowance.  

**Social confidence:**
Dennis is slowly working on building the habit of asking lecturers or other students for help, but he still has social anxiety. Dennis has low confidence in his talking and communication skills.
