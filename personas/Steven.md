**Bio:**
Steven is a 27-year-old lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. 
He has been lecturing for one year as course coordinator for a first-year criminology course.
He has been managing supplementary material for his course by creating and importing revision questions in a pdf format, distributing them via email.
This year the faculty has asked Steven to trial the SQS in his course before asking for his feedback to roll out the system to other disciplines.
Steven is undergoing research whiling teaching at the same time. He is currently under the pressure of reaching a breakthrough in criminological theory while trying his best to support the needs of his students. 
He values his growth in being the best lecturer he can in supporting his students. He is also trying to provide the best research to publish in one of the top scholarly journals. 

**Activities:**
Steven often has late starts in the morning due to working on his research throughout the evening and night. The first thing he does is to respond to emails and prepare for his lectures, tutorials, office hours. During the day he will often attend meetings and then carry out his lectures and set tasks. 
At weekends he enjoys rebuilding the rotary engine in his 1997 Mazda RX-7 RZ sports car and surfing at the beach.

**Attitudes:**
Steven is a calm and collected person.
Often he experiences nervousness and stress from the expectations of his colleagues and students but he tries to not take anything too personal.

**Aptitudes:**
Steven is creative and excels in planning which contributes to his qualities in the organisation in his responsibilities. He is also passionate about pursuing knowledge, often trying to research new things and tries to do it himself.

**Weaknesses:**
Steven often worries about the responsibilities and tasks that he did not carry out but did. Due to this, he often seeks confirmation that his actions were received and recognised. As a result, he is overly pedantic about his actions. 

**Domain Knowledge:**
Steven has been instructed and taught to use the SQS in his courses. He understands the collaborative aspects and his responsibilities in managing them.

**System Knowledge:**
Steven is aware of how the collaborative system works through the engagement of question creation, answering, rating and receiving feedback. He is also aware of the admin and moderation tools as it is his responsibility to utilise them.  

**Interaction:**
Steven checks the SQS at least twice a day when he has free time or during office hours. During this time, Steven checks the questions and provides appropriate feedback on the quality. He has not used the remove questions/comments functionality yet and hopes that he does not have to. Before two weeks a test is held, he plans to upload and import sample questions from last year to help students revise.

**Priorities:**
Steven wants to make sure that the students are using the system properly in a safe and collaborative environment. Steven would also like a feed of recent activity and changes in the system.

**Motivations:**
Steven is currently on a research breakthrough that may provide a significant impact on the academic area of criminology. His goal is to maximise the quality of his teaching resources and research while minimising effort.

**Computer self-efficacy:**
Steven can perform nearly all of the functions in the SQS. He has not used the moderation tools yet but is able to navigate and use them if necessary.

**Risk tolerance:**
Steven has a high risk tolerance due to the different systems he has used during his research. He also understands that he was instructed to trial the system and is open to any student feedback to pass back to the faculty's decision on a future rollout. 

**Information Processing:**
Steven is excellent at processing information due to the amount of literature and journal articles he researches. 

**Tinkering:**
Steven tries to experiment with different systems to take advantage of their features. He strongly believes that each system has its strengths and flaws that can be added to his toolbox and be deployed in a different context if required.
