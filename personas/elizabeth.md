Elizabeth is a first year student at Victoria University of Wellington, majoring in Biology. Her goal for studying is to gain a greater understanding of
biology. She is interested in pursuing an academic career and enjoys helping others build their understanding. Her goal for using Peerwise is to help her fellow students understand the course material.  

Elizabeth finds it easy to understand course material and has done well in her high school studies, and feels confident in her knowledge. She has not previously used Peerwise or any other crowd-sourced quiz platform, but has used old exams and quizzes in textbooks, and has helped other students during their previous studies.  

Elizabeth can usually figure out computer applications, but she likes applications that are simple and intuitive, as this reduces irritation and improves
productivity. She has good computer self-efficacy and doesnâ€™t mind experimenting.
