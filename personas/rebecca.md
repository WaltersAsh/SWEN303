Rebecca is a 21-year-old third-year student studying at Victoria University of Wellington. Her degree is the Bachelor of Biomedical Science majoring in Molecular Pharmacology and Medicinal Chemistry. Rebecca commutes from Upper Hutt and only goes to campus twice a week. Rebecca’s study goal is to have a thorough comprehension of her course content and achieve high grades in her assessments, so that it may contribute to her life goal of getting the tertiary qualifications needed to become a pharmacologist.

Rebecca primarily uses PeerWise to create test questions to study with and to discuss with other classmates and lecturers about lecture related topics and extension material.

**Interactions:**
Rebecca uses Peerwise multiple times a week on the days with lectures to create new study questions, and then once each day in the week before a test to review study questions. She also consults the course information questions when starting assignments to better understand the assignment specifications.

**Concentration ability:**
Rebecca is able to sustain focus during schoolwork and can filter out distractions.

**Time management:**
Rebecca watches most lectures at home due to her compact schedule and heavy workload of her courses but is able to allocate regular sessions to study material and work on assignments.

**Reading ability:**
Rebecca prefers clear, simple layouts of information but is able to parse dense textbook readings and work out assignment specifications from open-ended
instructions.

**Stresses in the environment:**
Rebecca’s home life with her family is comfortable and supportive. She does not have to plan her own meals or groceries. Unpredictable delays in
public transport such as road traffic, late buses or bus replacements of trains can make Rebecca anxious about being late for labs, but she manages this by leaving early and having backup plans. Rebecca has a part-time job in the field and is not too worried about eventually earning enough to pay her student loans.

**Social confidence:**
Rebecca is comfortable talking to peers and strangers and is not shy to build a rapport with lecturers or her boss to discuss course-related topics and her related interests.
