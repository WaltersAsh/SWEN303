## Background<a name="background"></a>

### Description  
Copy and paste description  
### Business Objectives  
Copy and paste business objectives here.  
Could discuss what features or aspects we want to focus on.  


## Personas<a name="personas"></a>  
Can copy and paste personas and modify them.  
More discussion is needed.  
### How personas were selected and merged  
- What was our process for selection?
- What criteria did we base our selection on?
- Why did we merge our personas?

### Persona 1  
### Persona 2  
### Persona 3  
### Persona 4


## Scenarios
Can copy and paste scenarios from selected personas and modify them. 
Maybe one scenario for each persona?  
### How scenarios were selected and merged
- What was our process for selection?
- What criteria did we base our selection on?
- Why did we merge our scenarios?

### Scenario 1  
### Scenario 2  
### Scenario 3  
### Scenario 4


## Designs Ideation<a name="ideation"></a>  
Copy and paste samples of designs from everyone here.  
Probably label each design and different aspects to refer to different parts, eg. design 1A.  


## Designs Review<a name="review"></a>    
Utilise heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs or a hybrid of both.  
List pros and cons of each designs from above, use labels to identify them.  
Probably individually review every design and combine results? 


## Prototype<a name="prototype"></a>     
### Description  
Description can be copied and pasted.  
### Interaction flow and hierarchy  
Show the flow of click-through in the context of scenarios/use cases? 
### Prototype Design
Design goes here.  
Probably take one of our existing designs and build upon it for time efficiency?  


## Demonstration Video<a name="video"></a>  
Video goes here.  


## Group Reflection<a name="reflection"></a>  
### Design merge reflection  
- How did we get together? 
- How did we decide and what was the process?  
- Were our decision technique effective?  
- What were some difficulties?
- Did we do anything wrong, if so what would we change next time?    
- What did we learn from this?

### Analysing best and worst aspects of the prototype
- What was good about the prototype?  
- What was bad about the prototype?
- What can we do to make it better?
- Did we do anything wrong, if so what would we change next time? 
- What did we learn from this?
