# Usability Testing Plan

## Methadology
How many users and what you are testing

Our system will be tested by 5? SWEN303 students from other participating groups.
Cognitive walkthrough method?
How we will meet/schedule the testing process - in person at uni?

Process
Disclosure and informing tester about collection of data

- how we will use it 
- how we will collect it
- How the process will work

Go through background of system - brief
Start process
During process, record results
End of process - debrief

## The script
What you say to the users

Background to the system
Steps of actions
Disclosure and informing tester about collection of data

## Roles
Who is doing what
Communicator
Notetaker
Recorder
Timekeeper
Transcriber of recorder's recording

## Tasks
How you are measuring

We are measuring based on 4 interactive sequences in our prototype.

Student 

- Logging into system to classrooms/dashboard
- Answering a question
- Starting a quiz

Lecturer
- Deleting a question

Process will involve an overarching interactive sequence and breakdown into subtasks for each.

Logging into system to classrooms/dashboard
- Logging into the system




## Metrics
what is the level you are happy with on the above metrics

At each subtask, measure:

- User's recognition of action
- If user's action is correct in achieving the substask

Then assess overall overaching task


how to measure the user's experience in completing the task
how long did they take to do the task
could they do it without hints from one of us
how would they rate it on eg 1-5 scale
is there more than one way to complete the task, ie what elements did they click and in what order

Record what they did/actions

Survey with questions 
- how they felt/experience

## Usability
How bad are the problems
