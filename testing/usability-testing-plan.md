# Usability Testing Plan

## Methodology
How many users and what you are testing

In our Student Questioning System prototype (SQS), we have decided that we will have 1 - 5 users to test. The users that will be testing our prototype are SWEN303 students from another group; Team 16 (Covid Trace 5) which was provided in the suggested pairings given. We plan to conduct our testing in person on campus but will allow flexibility via Zoom if it is not possible for our testers to meet. We aim to gather as many testers as possible to ensure that we have clarity in the feedback to differentiate the weaknesses and strengths in our prototype.   

We are testing the different interaction sequences that relate to the different features and functions in our system. We have defined these interaction sequences as the following:

- Logging into the system
- Selecting, answering and rating a question
- Starting and completing a quiz
- Creating a question

We have chosen these interaction sequences as they represent the most essential use cases and functions in our system. We are confident that these interactive sequences will allow us to collect feedback on the quality of the testers' experience and interaction with our prototype. These interaction sequences cover a large proportion of our prototype in terms of functionality and navigability.

### Process
After meeting with our testers in our agreed location, we will be giving testers a copy of the [information sheet and consent form](). We will inform the testers about our testing process and the prototype with background information. After they have signed the consent form, we will start the testing process with the tester using a laptop that we have provided with the prototype. We will ask the tester to perform our sequence interactions and record their operational data. After they have completed the sequence interactions or we are satisfied, we will interview the testers. We will be asking questions about their experience and feelings of the prototype. When the interview is completed, we will debrief them about the testing process and the prototype, concluding the process.

## The Script and Tasks
What you say to the users

In our user testing process, we will be communicating with the testers. We have defined two key stages which are briefing and testing. 

### Briefing
In this briefing stage, we will first hand out our information sheet and consent form. After they have read the information sheet and signed the consent form, we will introduce the background of our prototype. We will communicate the following:

```
Hello, thank you for taking time out of your day for helping us in testing our prototype.

Our prototype is a Student Questioning System (SQS), named PeerRevise, that is targeted at aiding university students in revising course material as part of question-based learning. Our goal is to receive as much feedback as possible to improve our prototype. The system provides three main features that help students revise, the features are; browsing and answering questions, starting a quiz which is a collection of questions, and creating a question. You will be testing these features in the prototype. This will be done on our laptop and we will communicate what you will need to do. At the end of the testing process, we will interview you on your experience and ask further questions. After this, the testing is completed and you will be free to go.
```

### Testing
During this testing process where the user is on the laptop testing our prototype, we will direct the tester through our prototype. We have created a table with the following; a task and its subtasks that the user will attempt to complete, what we will say to direct the user to attempt the task, and what we will say during an intervention where a user gets stuck.

| Task              | Subtasks                   | What we say                                             | Intervention - what we say and do                                              |

After the testing the prototype on our laptop, we will interview the user on their experience. The questions that we will ask are the following:

- Do you have any questions about the prototype?
- Tell us how did you feel when you were testing the prototype?
- On a scale from 1 - 5, rate your experience in testing the prototype, where 1 is very negative, 3 is neutral, and 5 is very positive.
- What are some parts of the prototype that you thought it was difficult to do or was not clear?
- What are some parts of the prototype that you thought it was easy or clear?
- If the prototype was fully functional, would you use this system for revising course material? Why or why not?

After the testing process and the interview, we will thank the user for their time and let them go.


## Metrics
what is the level you are happy with on the above metrics

At each subtask, measure:

- User's recognition of action
- If user's action is correct in achieving the substask

Then assess overall overaching task


how to measure the user's experience in completing the task
how long did they take to do the task
could they do it without hints from one of us
how would they rate it on eg 1-5 scale
is there more than one way to complete the task, ie what elements did they click and in what order

Record what they did/actions

Survey with questions 
- how they felt/experience

## Usability
How bad are the problems
