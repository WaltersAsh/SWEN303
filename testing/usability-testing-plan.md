# Usability Testing Plan

## Methodology
*How many users and what you are testing?*

In our Student Questioning System prototype (SQS), we have decided that we will have 1 - 5 users to test. The users that will be testing our prototype are SWEN303 students from another group; Team 16 (Covid Trace 5) which was provided in the suggested pairings given. We plan to conduct our testing in person on campus but will allow flexibility via Zoom if it is not possible for our testers to meet. We aim to gather as many testers as possible to ensure that we have clarity in the feedback to differentiate the weaknesses and strengths in our prototype.   

We are testing the different interaction sequences that relate to the different features and functions in our system. We have defined these interaction sequences as the following:

- Logging into the system
- Selecting, answering and rating a question
- Starting and completing a quiz
- Creating a question

We have chosen these interaction sequences as they represent the most essential use cases and functions in our system. We are confident that these interactive sequences will allow us to collect feedback on the quality of the testers' experience and interaction with our prototype. These interaction sequences cover a large proportion of our prototype in terms of functionality and navigability.

### Process
After meeting with our testers in our agreed location, we will be giving testers a copy of the [information sheet and consent form](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/swen303/2021/project1/t13/peerwise-project/-/blob/master/testing/information-sheet-and-consent-form-for-individual-user-tests.pdf). We will inform the testers about our testing process and the prototype with background information. After they have signed the consent form, we will start the testing process with the tester using a laptop that we have provided with the prototype. We will ask the tester to perform our sequence interactions and record their operational data. After they have completed the sequence interactions or we are satisfied, we will interview the testers. We will be asking questions about their experience and feelings of the prototype. When the interview is completed, we will debrief them about the testing process and the prototype, concluding the process.

## Roles
*Who is doing what*		

Interviewer - Communicating to the user and conducting the end interview.
Transcriber - Writing what the user said.
Recorder    - Writing/recording what the user does.
Timekeeper  - Tracking the time and writing time taken for the user to complete tasks.

## The Script and Tasks
*What will you say to the user and what we are testing?*

In our user testing process, we will be communicating with the testers. We have defined two key stages which are briefing and testing. 

### Briefing
In this briefing stage, we will first hand out our information sheet and consent form. After they have read the information sheet and signed the consent form, we will introduce the background of our prototype. We will communicate the following:

```
Hello, thank you for taking time out of your day for helping us in testing our prototype.

Our prototype is a Student Questioning System (SQS), named PeerRevise, that is targeted at aiding university students in revising course material as part of 
question-based learning. Our goal is to receive as much feedback as possible to improve our prototype. The system provides three main features that help 
students revise, the features are; browsing and answering questions, starting a quiz which is a collection of questions, and creating a question. You will 
be testing these features in the prototype. This will be done on our laptop and we will communicate what you will need to do. At the end of the testing 
process, we will interview you on your experience and ask further questions. The interviewer will not answer questions you ask during the testing. You also must not dicuss the testing with your other group members until your whole group has been tested. After this, the testing is completed and you will be free to go.
```

### Testing
During this testing process where the user is on the laptop testing our prototype, we will direct the tester through our prototype. We have created a table with the following; a task and its subtasks that the user will attempt to complete, what we will say to direct the user to attempt the task, and what we will say during an intervention where a user gets stuck.

We will intervene after the user has gone 30 seconds without completing the subtask

After the user has finished testing the prototype on our laptop, we will interview the user on their experience. After the testing process and the interview, we will thank the user for their time and let them go.

## Metrics
*How are you measuring?*

At each subtask, we will record the following:

- If the user's attempt in completing the task is successful
- How fast the user completes it (the time taken for the user completes the subtask)
- If an intervention was needed (the user asked for help)
- The user's actions or attempts in clicking 

After the user has finished testing the prototype on our laptop, we will interview the user on their experience. The questions that we will ask are the following:

- Do you have any questions about the prototype?
- Tell us how did you feel when you were testing the prototype?
- On a scale from 1 - 5, rate your experience in testing the prototype, where 1 is very negative, 3 is neutral, and 5 is very positive.
- What are some parts of the prototype that you thought it was difficult to do or was not clear?
- What are some parts of the prototype that you thought it was easy or clear?
- If the prototype was fully functional, would you use this system for revising course material? Why or why not?

We will record this information separately according to everyone's roles and combine our data into a private and confidential document.

## Usability Goals
*What is the level you are happy with on the above metrics?*

We have judged our metrics based on the following qualities:

- Clarity - Is the question understandable?
- Conciseness - Is the question short?
- Relevancy - Is it relevant to the topic and goal?
- Interest - Is it interesting to answer?
- Answerable - Does the question has an answer?
- Actionable - Will the answer be useful to our goal?

We believe that most of our questions meet these criteria and we are highly happy to ask these questions to the user.


## Usability
*How bad are the problems?*

From the feedback and data we have received from testing, we will be ranking issues and problems using Nielsen's Severity Rating.

Nielsen's Severity Rating:

- 0	 I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
- 1	 Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on the project
- 2	 Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
- 3	 Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
- 4	 Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before the product can be released
